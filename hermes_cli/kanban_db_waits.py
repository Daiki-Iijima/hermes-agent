    ``dependency`` never enters the human ``blocked`` bucket: it waits in
    ``todo`` for ``recompute_ready``, so a cron never sees a dependency-wait
    as something to "unblock". Every other kind counts unblock-loop
    recurrences: block_task only fires from running/ready (AFTER an unblock
    returned the task to the pool), so a stored ``block_kind`` equal to the
    incoming one means blocked -> unblocked -> re-block for the same cause
    (un-typed None compares equal to a prior un-typed block). At
    ``kb.BLOCK_RECURRENCE_LIMIT`` the task routes to ``triage`` for a human.
